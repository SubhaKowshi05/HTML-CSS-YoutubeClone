# HTML-CSS-YoutubeClone
A front-end YouTube Clone developed using HTML5 and CSS3. The project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML, Flexbox/Grid layout, responsive design, and modern CSS properties to recreate a YouTube-like user interface. This project was created to strengthen my understanding of web design fundamentals.
